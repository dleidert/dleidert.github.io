[Debichem](https://wiki.debian.org/Debichem) is a team effort to package and maintain chemistry-related packages in [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org). It was founded by [Michael Banck](https://www.credativ.de/blog/michael-banck) in 2005/2006. Until then packages usually had been maintained by a single person or a small group and packaging files had been stored locally. With the availability of the [Alioth service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alioth_%28Debian%29) a platform had been created, which introduced the concept of team maintenance to everyone invloved in Debian by providing

* different versions control systems (<abbr title="Version Control Systems">VCS</abbr>) like <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System"><abbr title="Concurrent Version System">CVS</abbr></a>, <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion"><abbr title="Subversion">SVN</abbr></a> and later <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GIT</a> to centrally store the packaging files and
* mailing lists for user and developer discussions and to collect bug mails at a central place.

In these early years I already maintained a few chemistry related packages, like my [own](https://github.com/dleidert/chemical-mime/) [chemical-mime-data](https://packages.qa.debian.org/chemical-mime-data) or the [GNOME chemistry utils](https://packages.qa.debian.org/gnome-chemistry-utils) and had contact with Michael. So I immediately joined this team effort. Over the years I've been a key maintainer for several other packages like [ShelXle](https://packages.qa.debian.org/shelxle), [GAMGI](https://packages.qa.debian.org/gamgi) or [Gabedit](https://packages.qa.debian.org/gabedit) and [helped packaging a lot more](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=dleidert).

As of the time of writing I'm still part of this team, that is now [located](https://salsa.debian.org/debichem-team) on [Salsa](https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa) - which [replaced Alioth](https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa/AliothMigration) - and [maintains more than 70 packages](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=debichem-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org), and also handled the [subversion-to-git migration](https://salsa.debian.org/debichem-team/team/svn2git).
