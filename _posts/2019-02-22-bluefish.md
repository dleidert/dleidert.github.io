[`bluefish`](https://bluefish.openoffice.nl) is an open source editor. It was originally designed as an HTML editor for Linux systems. I started participating in this project in around 2005 with some basic autotools related stuff for upstream and also with my first packaging attempts for the [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) distribution. I [became the official Debian package maintainer](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=322091#64) even in the <time datetime="2005-08-24">same year</time>. Since then my upstream related tasks within this project were:

* maintain and improve autotools related build infrastructure
* maintain German translation
* fix bugs (especially those reported by Debian users)
* add some functionality (mainly for improving website accessibility and SEO)
* improve the PCRE based syntax highlighting files of bluefish series 1.x
* improve modern Linux desktop integration (implement freedesktop.org standards)
* co-maintain and update the [project websites](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl)
* initially port the program to run on Windows (first run on [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com), later run natively)
* make the internationalization (using gettext) work on Windows
* create a first Windows installer

As Debian package maintainer I 

* [cared about user bug reports](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?archive=both;correspondent=daniel.leidert%40wgdd.de;correspondent=dleidert%40debian.org;src=bluefish),
* provided backports,
* kept the package up-to-date and
* in shape to the [Debian Policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/)

for the distribution.

Today `bluefish` is a full-featured editor targeted not only towards web-developers but to programmers too. Even if based on [GTK](https://www.gtk.org) it uses a self-written and fast syntax highlighting engine instead of [GtkSourceView](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView). I was part of the upstream author team and the Debian package maintainer until <time datetime="2018-01-21">early 2018</time> and I enjoyed working with Olivier Sessink and the other members of the team. Thanks for a great time.
