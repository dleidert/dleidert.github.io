{% include json/person.json %}

I'm a 40 year old chemist and [Debian developer](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=dleidert@debian.org "Overview of Debian Linux packages maintained by Daniel Leidert"), working for a public municipal environmental protection office. In my [blog](https://www.wgdd.de) I write about everything concerning me: Debian, Windows, issues to hardware or software I'm related to, politics and hobbies.

Below is a list of projects I created or particpated in.
